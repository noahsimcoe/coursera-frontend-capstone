This is my capstone project for the Meta Frontend Developer certificate that I took through Coursera.com. For this project we were tasked with creating a website for a restaurant, in this case 'Little Lemon', who needed to create a working reservation on their website.

Working on this project was a great intro into working with React.js, where I used HTML/CSS/JS to structure my webiste, style it correctly, and provide simple interacivity to it.

The reservation data for this project is stored in a JSON file that is stored on a JSON server that must be ran with "npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000" prior to submitting new inputs on the reservation form. This was used in place of a constantly running database.
